						The United States of America needs to slow down. Democracy is slow and clumsy.
						Consensus takes time. It is not efficient. It often doesn&rsquo;t produce much
						beyond conversation. That&rsquo;s what the founders sought. If they wanted
						quick and efficient, they&rsquo;ve have kept their king. Yet if you ever felt
						inclined to speed up this form of government, silencing voices is an efficient
						way of doing so. And that happens when a city council refuses public comment.
						It happens when civic classes are removed from classrooms. It happens every
						election, when candidates want you to know their name but won&rsquo;t engage
						with constituents after they&rsquo;ve won. During this course, I asked how
						might we slow down and expand civic engagement beyond election day into every
						day?
					</p>
					<p>
						In starting out, seeing this a learning experience, I hypothesized ways one
						might want to engage with others (learner-to-learner), their elected officials
						& political leaders/organizers (learner-to-facilitator), and the government
						processes (learner-to-content) so that one could learn how the system
						operates, their place within it, and how they can effect change. The end goal
						being to sustain a citizen&rsquo;s interest over long enough time that
						political engagement becomes another facet of their everyday lives. Some
						considerable constraints include time and resources. The project is
						overwhelming in scope, and just like democracy itself, would only be effective
						if developed with as much input as possible. So, I decided to focus on
						building as much empathy as possible between the design team and the populace.
						I went about developing a role-playing prototype so that designers can wear as
						many hats as possible in various scenarios that may occur when experiencing
						the end product. This would take place after a long discovery phase of
						conducting interviews and field studies to produce various user personas to
						use during the role-playing prototype. I also invision this happening before
						approaching the project&rsquo;s UI. Throughout this course, I continually
						asked myself, &ldquo;Why would anyone trust this experience?&rdquo; Trust
						seems to be at an all-time low in American politics. So, the focus of these
						role-play prototypes would be to create a first impression for new users that
						exudes trust.

					<p>
						In these role-play exercises, one designer would play a user persona in
						various scenarios. Both user persona and scenario used in each session would
						be displayed on cue cards during the session. This designer would speak aloud
						their inner thoughts about what they&rsquo;re experiencing. Another designer
						would play the end product&rsquo;s interface and react as best as they could
						to create trust. A third designer would observe and take notes. Before and
						after each session are built-in reflection breaks to capture how designers
						thought the role-play session went and why. Key features include being able to
						rapidly combine different user personas and scenarios for trying out various
						combinations that could occur. Another is not just to empathize with people
						from/in different backgrounds and settings, but for the designers to reflect
						on the goals they&rsquo;re trying to achieve. It isn&rsquo;t enough to use
						this moment to ask if they&rsquo;re designing a comfortable experience for the
						users. The designers could get swept up with trying to build a trusting,
						comforting experience, and lose the overarching goal. And so, a common
						question during reflection will be for designers to ask, &ldquo;During this
						session, did you solve the problem correctly (build trust with the user)? Did
						you solve the
						<em>right</em> problem correctly (build trust without the expense of moving
						away from the overarching goal)?&rdquo; From this design, the more I explored
						the idea of this role-playing prototype, the more I realized how difficult it
						seems to approach the UI without first understanding for whom I am designing
						the interface. It made me more aware of the need to avoid jumping to
						conclusions in design. During this course, all of my time dealing with this
						prototype was theoretical. Next time, I&rsquo;d like to test the prototype out
						with others to see how successful it could actually be.
