					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>
						This started primarily as a typography concern. FSCJ has a wide
						range of learners of different backgrounds and my teams places a
						large emphasis on accessibility and inclusion; to be empathic to
						their needs. We have learners whose English is not their first
						language, older learners who do not see as well as they used to,
						learners with cognitive concerns, such as dyslexia, and others, that
						make reading more difficult. So, we reached out to our leadership to
						begin asking the question: how many we improve the online learning
						experience for any learners using our LMS? How might we make sure
						learners can focus on the content, without anything getting in the
						way and taking them out of their learning flow?
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								This process began by analyzing the typeface used in our
								college’s style guide (<a
									href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?category=Sans+Serif,Display,Handwriting,Monospace&query=open+sans"
									target="_blank"
									class="linkOut"
									>Open Sans</a
								>) and the typeface used in Canvas by default (<a
									href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?category=Sans+Serif,Display,Handwriting,Monospace&query=lato"
									target="_blank"
									class="linkOut"
									>Lato</a
								>) against an accessibility matrix we drafted to check for
								readability. We did this because, currently, there are no set
								standards for which typefaces are considered to have high
								readability—although there are some, such as Arial, that are
								highly regarded. We found neither Open Sans or Lato reached hit
								our requirements. We presented these findings to leadership and
								faculty committees at the college and were given the greenlight
								to research other typefaces.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								During this process, we aimed to adhere to the spirit of our
								college’s style guide and Canvas’s design system while knowing
								we would have to break out a bit to reach out accessibility
								standards. After going through numerous fonts, we found
								<a
									href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont"
									target="_blank"
									class="linkOut"
									>Atkinson Hyperlegible</a
								>. Using this font, we found other style changes that we needed
								to implement to smooth together this new font within the
								existing LMS.

								><img src="img/fscj-canvas-page.png" alt=""
							/></a>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Having found a typeface that provided a higher level of
								readability for our learners, we reached out to the college’s
								student support services department and the college’s vision
								education and rehabilitation center to get their expert
								feedback, working with learners with disabilities firsthand.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Our final step before being implemented is currently underway.
								We presented our style changes to faculty and there will be a
								full faculty senate vote on the change. If that is approved,
								these changes will go to the live server to aid learners in
								their online learning experiences.
