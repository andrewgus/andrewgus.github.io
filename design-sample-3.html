					Online Course Template for Exploring Purpose in&nbsp;General Education

					<h2>Challenge</h2>

					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>
						For the capstone project of my LXD certification with Oregon State
						University, I set out to design a template for higher education
						faculty and designers who are developing general education courses.
						This template&rsquo;s purpose would <em>not</em> be to try to
						customize the content to the learner, but to allow learners and
						faculty to construct their own meaning and use it throughout the
						course so that the content remains relevant to them.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								During my undergraduate career and then working as an eLearning
								multimedia designer at a community college, I've seen that many
								learners in required general education courses are not sure the
								coursework applies to them. They do the work because they must,
								but not becuase it is their interest. Rather than keeping the
								current frame of these courses&mdash;a one-to-many relationship
								where the course attempts to explain why the subject is
								important&mdash;I sought to reframe the course as a many-to-one
								relationship, where each person applies their own meaning to the
								course.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								After conducting interviews with undergraduate learners,
								faculty, and other designers, I decided to focus on a common
								part of every online course: the <em>Start Here</em> module.
								Colleges tend to use this module to explain important
								information about the course, but it not very exciting or
								interactive. I wanted to reframe this aspect of the course from
								simply telling the learner what is important, to providing
								learners the opportunity to reflect on what the course means to
								them and work in small groups to customize the course, where
								possible, to have the course better fit their constructed
								meaning.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The <em>Start Here</em> module would end with a democratic
								discussion and vote where all learners would be able to decide,
								with the instructor/facilitator, how they could customize the
								course. The more important aspect of this is allowing all
								learners to the chance to discover their own meaning, regardless
								of how the course is customized, <em>and</em> to hear how others
								view the course.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								In addition, I also redesigned another common aspect of online
								courses, the <em>Instructor Resources</em> module, to be
								interactive for the faculty member teaching the course. The goal
								here was to provide faculty the opportunity to reflect on how
								this course (and learners&rsquo; perception of it) changes what
								they think about their own field of study.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Finally, throughout the course, I created small group
								discussions and whole-class discussions to check in about what
								is and isn&rsquo;t working. This gives learners and faculty the
								chance to act as co-designers of the course rather than passive
								consumers within an online course.
