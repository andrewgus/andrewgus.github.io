					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>
						My team at Florida State College at Jacksonville was tasked with
						designing an online funeral directing course. Previous funeral
						directing courses failed to provide learners an opportunity to try
						an important practical skill they'd need in the field: arranging a
						funeral processional and recessional. For this design, I worked with
						an&nbsp;instructional designer (ID), web developer, and another
						multimedia designer, with a funeral director as our subject
						matter&nbsp;expert&nbsp;(SME).
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>Our challenge started with an image.</p>
							<img
								class="designCase-img"
								src="img/original-processional-img.png"
								alt="A black and white, stick-figure illustration of a roman catholic funeral processional."
							/>
							<p>
								In the previous iteration of this course, learners only had this
								image with text to teach them how to arrange a Roman Catholic
								processional. Through consultations to empathize with the SME
								and define the problem, we discovered an underlying issue: the
								course was not providing hands-on experience to fully prepare
								learners to be new funeral directors.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								In the ideation stage, we determined how best to provide an
								accessible, engaging learning experience. Learners needed to be
								able to try out what they believed was correct prior to seeing
								the results for self-assessment. We also concluded it should be
								low-stakes (not graded) and repeatable, so that they could
								continue to work on what they knew if they ever felt uncertain.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Our prototyping led to a fully accessible drag-and-drop learning
								activity so that learners could play with the elements
								(necessary people and items) on the &ldquo;board&rdquo; (the
								interior of a religion building) to test their knowledge of
								funeral processionals and recessionals.
