				<h1>Online Course Template for Exploring Purpose in&nbsp;General Education Courses</h1>
				<section class="wicked-problem">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>How might we afford learners and faculty the opportunity to construct their own meaning and find purpose within a higher education required course, commonly known as general education (gen. ed.) courses.</p>
				</section><!-- end wicked-problem -->	
				<section class="designCase-outline">
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>For the capstone project of my LXD certification with Oregon State University, I set out to design a template for faculty and designers to use when developing general education courses for higher education. This template&rsquo;s purpose would be to <em>not</em> try to customize the content to the learner, but to allow learners &amp; faculty the opportunity to construct their own meaning about the content and use their personal meaning throughout the course so that the content is relevant to them.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
								<p>During my undergraduate career and then working as an eLearning multimedia designer at a community college, I noticed many learners in general education courses are not quite sure how the required course they are taking applies to them. They do the work because they must do the work, but not becuase it is their interest. Rather than keeping the current frame of these courses: a one-to-many relationship where the course attempts to explain why the subject is important. I sought to reframe the course to a many-to-one relationship, where each person applies their own meaning to the course.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>After conducting interviews with undergraduate learners, faculty, and other designers, I decided to focus most of my efforts on a common part of every online course: the <em>Start Here</em> module. This module tends to be used by most colleges to explain important information about a course, but it not very exciting or interactive. I wanted to reframe this aspect of the course from one where the course tells a learner what is important, to the course explaining itself, but providing the learner the opportunity to reflect on what the course means to them and work in small groups to customize the course, where possible, to have the course better fit their constructed meaning.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The start here module would end with a democratic discussion and vote where all learners would be able to decide, with the instructor/facilitator, how they could customize the course. The more important aspect of this is allowing all learners to the chance to discover their own meaning, regardless of how the course is customized, <em>and</em> to hear how others view the course. This way, learners</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>In addition, another common aspect of online course design, the <em>Instructor Resources</em> module is already redesigned to be interactive for the faculty member teaching the course. The goal here to provide faculty the opportunity to reflect on how this course and the learners&rsquo; perceptions of it, change what they think about their own field of study.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Finally, throughout the course, there are check-ins with small group discussions and whole-class discussions to determine what is and isn&rsquo;s working and how they can improve the course. This give learners and faculty the chance to act as co-designers of the course themselves, rather than passive consumers within an online course.</p>
