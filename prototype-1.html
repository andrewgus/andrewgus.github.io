					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>How might we foster internal motivation in paid subject matter experts when collaborating with LX designers to design and build a course?</p>
				</section><!-- end wicked-problem -->	
				<div class="prototype-outline">
					<p>For this first prototype, I sought to reframe a SME&rsquo;s role from content producers to co-designers. To this end, I want to &ldquo;design for designers&rdquo; as <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/mres/overview/" target="_blank">Mitchel Resnick</a> says. I started with an outline of how I see this progressing:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Prior to <em>initial meeting</em> with subject matter expert (SME), send out questionnaire to gather an idea of SME&rsquo;s motivation, goals, and base knowledge of what LX designers can do for them and their course. Questionnaire will be pointed toward getting SME to think about how they&rsquo;d wish to improve the course, what has worked/not worked in the past, and discovering a challenge they want to solve.</p>
							<div class="lx-tools">
								<p>Tool used:</p>
								<div class="sample">
									<a href="https://forms.gle/6ChcHXp8LbJhNesT7" target="_blank"><p>Questionnaire: Google Forms</p></a>
								</div><!-- end sample-->
								
							</div><!-- end lx-tools-->
						</li>
						<li><p>During the <em>initial meeting</em>, based off the SME&rsquo;s completed questionnaire, work with SME to build upon the ideas and goals they&rsquo;re most excited about and work to uncover <em>why</em> they are most excited about those ideas. This would also be an opportunity to address any unperceived or mispercived needs of the SME.</p>
							<p>End intial meeting by starting divergent thinking collaboration, centered around further uncovering the goals/problem the SME hopes achive/solve with this development. We would collaborate using Office 365. The SME and LX Designers could continue to add to this list after the meeting ends.</p>

								<div class="sample">
									<a href="https://www.webex.com/" target="_blank"><p>Meeting: WebEx</p></a>
								</div><!-- end sample-->
								<div class="sample">
									<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software" target="_blank"><p>Meeting: Microsoft Teams</p></a>

								</div><!-- end sample-->
							</div><!-- end lx-tools-->
						</li>
						<li><p>Prior to <em>Kick-off</em> meeting, SME and LX Designers would work collaboratively on the document to converge on their top goal &amp; the enduring knowledge they want to impart.</p>

								</div><!-- end sample-->
							</div><!-- end lx-tools-->
						</li>
						<li><p>During <em>Kick-off</em> meeting, goal/problem is established, along with learning outcomes and objectives.</p></li>
						<li><p>Course development then begins. This will also be the prototyping phase. LX Designers will be build prototypes and SMEs will provide feedback through <em>on-going</em> meetings.</p>
							<p>LX Designers will encourage SMEs to include their past and/or present learners to provide feedback as well as their colleagues, if they so desire to do so. This third party feedback may turn into online meetings to better understand feedback provided.</p>

								</div><!-- end sample-->
						</li>
						<li><p>Finally, the course will be piloted by the SME for one semester prior to being useable by all faculty. Right now, communication at this phase in our devleopment cycle ceases between designers and SME. Assuming intrinsic motivation is improved through changes in this process, that open line of communication would strengthen. Ideally, SME would continue to provide designers with feedback throughout their pilot and continue a collaborative process of divergent and convergent thought on ways to improve the next iteration of the course.</p>
