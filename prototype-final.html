					<p>How might we shift our current course design process to view, and include, subject matter experts as co-designers alongside LX designers for a transformational experience?</p>

				<div class="prototype-outline">
					<p>For the final prototype of this course, I focused on tightening up loose ends from my design moves. As stated in previous prototypes, my aim remains to &ldquo;design for designers&rdquo; as <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/mres/overview/" target="_blank">Mitchel Resnick</a> says. </p>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Begin <em>initial meeting</em> with informal discussion between subject matter expert (SME) and LX designers based on &ldquo;5 Whys&rdquo; analysis. Together, the team will explore SME&rsquo;s motivation, goals, and expectations of the design process. Questions will be provided to LX designers to focus discussion toward getting SME to think about how they&rsquo;d wish to improve the course, what has worked/not worked in the past, and discovering a challenge they want to solve. Not every question provided must be asked. This would also be an opportunity to address any unperceived or misperceived needs of&nbsp;the&nbsp;SME.</p>
							<p>If time, scheduling, or other constraints prohibit &ldquo;5 Whys&rdquo; discussion, an optional online questionnaire will be made available prior to the initial meeting. <strong>These questions would be the same as in-person discussion</strong>, but without the ability have a natural conversation around them as would happen in an in-person discussion.</p>

							<p>End initial meeting by starting brainstorming collaboration session. The brainstorming method used can be tailored based on SMEs preference. The purpose of the session will be centered around further uncovering the goals/problem the SME hopes to achieve/solve with this design process. We would collaborate using Office 365 or Miro (depending on the SME&rsquo;s comfort level with technology). The SME and LX Designers will continue to brainstorm on their joint document after the meeting ends.</p>

						<li><p>Prior to <em>Kick-off</em> meeting, SME and LX Designers would work collaboratively on the brainstorming document to converge on their top goal &amp; the enduring knowledge they want to impart.</p>
							<p>LX Designers will encourage SMEs to include their department colleagues to provide feedback on what the course&rsquo;s aim should be. SMEs will only need to provide name and contact info of colleagues to LX designers and they will facilitate the feedback session(s).</p>

						<li><p>During <em>Kick-off</em> meeting, goal/problem is established, along with learning outcomes and objectives.</p></li>
						<li><p>Course development then begins. This is the prototyping phase. SMEs will have access to view the course, within the college&rsquo;s learning management system (LMS), throughout the development process. LX Designers will build prototypes and SMEs will provide feedback through <em>on-going</em> meetings. </p>

						<li><p>Finally, the SME will pilot for one semester prior to it being available for use to all faculty. Right now, communication at this phase in our design process is nonexistent between designers and SME. Assuming intrinsic motivation is improved through changes in this process, a line of communication would open here. Ideally, the SME would continue to provide designers with feedback throughout their pilot, even if formal meetings cease, and continue a collaborative brainstorming document on ways to improve the next iteration of the course.</p>
